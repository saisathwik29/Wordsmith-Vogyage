            <h2>The Surprising Strategy to Winning any Argument</h2>
        <img src="art3.jpg" alt="Featured Image"></div>
       <p> There is no bigger current affairs show on British television than the BBC’s Question Time. For more than 40 years, millions have tuned
         in week after week to watch the country’s leading politicians and pundits argue and debate the news in front of a live studio audience. </p>

        <p>In January 2015, I was invited to join the Question Time panel. It was the week after the Charlie Hebdo terror attack, in which two 
            French Muslim brothers had murdered 12 people at the offices of the satirical newspaper in Paris. In the weeks and months running up to the
             attack, offensive and racist cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad published by Charlie Hebdo had caused outrage and protests across Muslim-majority countries.</p>
        <p>I knew the show’s producers were keen to have a Muslim voice on the panel—and, to be honest, I was keen to be that voice. In fact, I was beyond grateful to have 
            access to such a huge media platform from which to try and push back against the usual Islamophobia that is unleashed in the wake of every ISIS- or al-Qaeda–linked
             terror attack. But I knew it wouldn’t be easy, and I knew I had to do it with a light touch.</p>

        <p>That night, the opening question from the audience was about the violence in Paris and the Charlie Hebdo cartoons: “Free speech is good, but where do you draw the line
             before it becomes harmful and offensive?” And, for the opening response, host David Dimbleby handed the stage over to me.</p>

        <p>I began by making clear that I was appalled—by the massacre in Paris, by homicidal maniacs abusing my religion to justify their crimes.</p>

        <p><blockquote>“As a Muslim, I’m not going to pretend that depictions of the Prophet Muhammad in a very racialized, sexualized, even terroristic way don’t offend me.</blockquote>
             Clearly, they do. Why wouldn’t they? But as a Muslim, I also have to say, what offends me, what outrages me much, much more is the spilling of innocent blood in the name of 
             Islam, in the name of my religion, and in the name of my Prophet.” Then I pivoted to the broader issue of free speech and the right to offend. Much of the debate in the news 
             at the time concerned whether other media organizations in the West, including in the UK, should also be publishing offensive cartoons of the Prophet, in the name of “free speech” 
             and in “solidarity” with Charlie Hebdo. I thought it was a bizarre argument. Why should we be offending the world’s Muslims again and again to score a point against a bunch of dead 
             terrorists? But it was a sensitive subject, innocents had been killed, and I decided to use humour to try and push back against that line of argument.</p>

<p>On the specific question of free speech ... we do have limits on free speech. Some people have been acting over the last week as if there is an absolute, untrammelled right to say whatever you like,
     whenever you like. That’s not true. There are legal limits and there are moral limits. Forget things we ban. There are things we just don’t say out of taste, out of decency. Sorry to be crude, but 
     you have the right to fart in a crowded lift; you just don’t do it, though, do you? And when you do it, and if somebody attacks you for it, that attack is outrageous, but you don’t expect everybody
      else in the lift to fart in solidarity with you.”</p>

<p>I admit, it was a risky joke to make. But the audience erupted in laughter and applause. I believe I may in fact have been the first person—and probably also the last!— to say “fart” on-air in the history 
    of Question Time. But that light-hearted analogy, first coined by journa-list Gary Younge, allowed me to make a key point about limits on free speech—and it became a moment that everyone would remember in
     an otherwise very serious discussion that night.</p>

<p>Laughter, as the old saying goes, is the best medicine. But it’s also one of the best ways to win an argument, one of the crucial ingredients of a good speech, and one of the few rhetorical strategies that an 
    audience will always appreciate. So make them laugh. And don’t be afraid to lighten the mood. In my experience, humour serves three purposes in a speech or debate:</p>
